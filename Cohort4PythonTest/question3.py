# Question 3(i)
#  Write a Python program that prompts a user to enter numbers. The process will repeat until
#  the user enters 0. Finally, the program prints sum of the numbers entered by the user.
# number =int(input('Enter numbers:\t'))
# sum = 0
# sum += number
# print(f'The sum of numbers is : {sum}')

# while True:
#     number = int(input('Enter numbers:\t'))
#     if number == 0:
#         print("stop")
        
        
    









# Question 3(ii)
# Write a Python program to print all the numbers from 1 to 100 that are not divisible by 2
